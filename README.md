# Genevatodolist (in minecraft)

> I spent too much time on this shitpost

You can expect a 2D "platformer" with roguelike mechanics and slotmachines. Sometimes it breaks - I dont care.

## Instalation

Head to the [releases](https://github.com/antosatko/genevatodolist/releases) section and pick the version you like.

## Building from source

Requirements:

 - [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) - application thingy
 - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - language that the application thingy uses

## Controls

I took a heavy inspiration from *Guilty gear*s deafult configuration. I will ignore any criticism - get good loser.

The game has the capability to change the keybinds, let me know if you think it is an important addition.

 - **Movement** - `A`, `D`, `Space`
 - **Aim** - `W`, `S`
 - **Abilities** - `U` *normal*, `I` *special*
 - **Inventory** - `J` *left*, `K` *right*, `1`, `2`, `3`

## Contributing

The codebase is a mess but a good mess.

Do whatever you want but do not expect me to merge anything.

## Most importantly

I hate JavaScript <3
